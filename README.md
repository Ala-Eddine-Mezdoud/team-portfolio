## üß† Team Retrospective Analysis

During this project, our biggest technical challenge was managing collaboration between six developers working on the same repository. Everyone was adding their own profile page and images, which caused several merge conflicts and version mismatches. We also faced issues with GitHub branch protection rules that blocked direct pushes to the `main` branch, forcing us to understand and properly use pull requests.

To resolve merge conflicts, we decided to standardize our workflow. Each member created a feature branch for their section, then opened a pull request into the `development` branch. After testing and confirming everything worked locally, we merged `development` into `main`. One specific conflict happened when multiple members edited the `team.html` and `index.html` files at the same time. We fixed this by comparing both versions line by line, keeping the latest updates from each teammate, and committing a clean merged version. This experience helped everyone understand Git‚Äôs merging logic and how to communicate effectively during integration.

The pull request and peer review process turned out to be very helpful. It forced us to double-check each other‚Äôs code and prevented accidental overwrites or broken links. The review system also made sure everyone‚Äôs contribution was visible and traceable. By the end, our workflow became much smoother ‚Äî we were pushing cleaner commits, catching mistakes earlier, and maintaining a consistent design across all profiles. Overall, using pull requests and reviews improved the code quality and helped us finish a polished final website as a team.
